# DLD_Circuits
This repository contains my lab files for DLD (Diode Logic with Feedback) circuits. These circuits are digital logic circuits that use diodes and resistors to implement logic functions. The files include circuit diagrams, truth tables, and simulation results.

Each lab file corresponds to a specific DLD circuit, and includes a description of the circuit's function and how it was designed. The files are organized by lab session and include both individual and group assignments.

Overall, these lab files provide a comprehensive introduction to DLD circuits and demonstrate their use in digital systems. They are suitable for students and hobbyists interested in digital electronics and circuit design.

These files are executed in Logisim App if u dont have it please download it using this link: -
